# Assignment 4 - Tree Expression Evaluator (CSCI-36300)


## Summarized Instructions for assignment from the professor:  
    No Shell Files were provided by the professor in this assignment.  

    This assignment will be the second implementation of the expression evaluator
    using a different set of patterns.

    In this assignment, the Composite Pattern, Visitor Pattern, and Builder Patterns must be used.

    The Infix to Postfix algorithm must also be included that was discussed in class.  

    This must be a complete program and must be able to at least handle the operators:  
    +, -, /, *, %, (, ), integers (positive & negative)  

    All expressions will have a space between each token so that parsing is 
    easier since the focus is the design.

    All input should be from STDIN while All output should go to STDOUT.  

    To quit the app, the user must type QUIT (all caps)  


## Summarized Instructions left for grader:  
    1) Clone to your local folder on Tesla.  
    2) Create a driver that starts run.cpp and provides input.
    3) Replace `driver.cpp` with your testing file.  
    4) Type ``make`` in the appropriate directory   
    5) Type ``./assignment4`` to run the executable.  
    6) Check for memory leaks using ``valgrind ./assignment4``  


In this assignment, I had also added implied multiplication, but had commented it out due to the auto-grader considering it incorrect input.


That's it!
