# Assignment 1 - The Array Class (CSCI-36300)

## Summarized Instructions for assignment from the professor:  
    Design and implement a standard array class for characters (char).  

    The goal of the assignment is to be a refresher for C++ and ADTs.  

    For this reason, the professor has included the design (header file) of the Array class.  

    My job was to implement the design given the the shells of the source code and implement
    the correct functionality.  

    A side note left by the professor that the use of the Standard Template Library (STL) 
    or Standard C Library string methods such as copy and fill were not allowed 
    when implementing the Array Class.


## Summarized Instructions left for grader:  
    1) Clone to your local folder on Tesla (Uni Server).  
    2) Replace `driver.cpp` with your testing file.  
    3) Type ``make`` in the appropriate directory  
    4) Type ``./Array`` to run the executable.  
    5) Check for memory leaks using ``valgrind ./Array``  


That's it!
