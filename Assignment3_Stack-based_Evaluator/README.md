# Assignment 3 - Calculator - Just "Stack" It Next to Me (CSCI-36300)

## Summarized Instructions for assignment from the professor:  
    No Shell Files were provided by the professor in this assignment.  

    Create a basic expression evaluator using the Stack made in Assignment 2.  

    The Infix to Postfix algorithm must also be included that was discussed in class.  

    The Command Pattern must also be used to evaluate the Postfix expression.  

    The Abstract Factory Pattern must also be used to create the commands based  
    on parsing the infix expression to a postfix expression.

    This must be a complete program and must be able to at least handle the operators:  
    +, -, /, *, %, (, ), integers (positive & negative)  

    All expressions will have a space between each token so that parsing is 
    easier since the focus is the design.

    All input should be from STDIN while All output should go to STDOUT.  

    To quit the app, the user must type QUIT (all caps)  




## Summarized Instructions left for grader:  
    1) Clone to your local folder on Tesla.  
    2) Create a driver that starts run.cpp and provides input.
    3) Replace `driver.cpp` with your testing file.  
    4) Type ``make`` in the appropriate directory   
    5) Type ``./assignment3`` to run the executable.  
    6) Check for memory leaks using ``valgrind ./assignment3``  


That's it!
