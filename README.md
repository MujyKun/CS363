# Principles of Software Design (IUPUI-CSCI-36300)

[![Codacy Badge](https://api.codacy.com/project/badge/Grade/4dc5c6bd8b5146bfa0e500fc2aa4f2be)](https://app.codacy.com/gh/MujyKun/CS363?utm_source=github.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_content=MujyKun/CS363&utm_campaign=Badge_Grade_Settings)

## What is this?
    This is a compilation of four assignments that were created in my 363 class at IUPUI.  

## What were the assignments?
    The first assignment was an Array Class.  

    The second assignment was a Queue, Stack, and Fixed Array built on top of that Array class.  
    
    The third assignment was creating an expression evaluator (calculator) using the Command 
    and Abstract Factory pattern and built from the ADTs in assignment 2. 

    The fourth assignment was creating an improved expression evaluator (calculator) from a Tree 
    using the Composite, Visitor, and Builder Patterns. This also used the ADTs from assignment 2.  

    More information about these assignments can be found in the README in their directories.

## Proper Refs
    In the first two assignments, the professor for my class had provided 
    shells (header files) to the assignments and did not entirely include my code. 

    The logic added in all four assignments were implemented by me.

## Additional 
    Majority of the comments made by my professor mid-grading were removed 
    to keep the code more readable. The professor's github username 
    was also removed across the project for their privacy.  

    Each assignment includes its own README with a general summary or conclusion to what I 
    had done in the assignment followed with the instructions. 

    Any student honor pledges have been removed.  

    All of my testing/driver files will not be included, however a run file may be included on 
    some assignments so they can properly be utilized.  

    All files were made to run on the Tesla servers (My uni server) with C++ 11.  

    All of these assignments were graded by an auto-grader coded by the professor. 
    No information was given on the auto-grader, but a report of any failed cases were given 
    back for the assignment. 

**All makefiles were created using [The Makefile, Project, and Workspace Creator (MPC)](https://github.com/DOCGroup/MPC)**
